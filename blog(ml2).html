        <h1>Why is leadership important for managers?</h1>
        <img src="./asset/image/manager.jfif"><br><br>
        Leadership is perhaps the most important function of management - it helps to maximise efficiency which can help to achieve the overall 
        vision and goals of the business. Here are some points that justify why leadership is so important in regard to management.

        <h4>Initiates action</h4>
        A leader is someone who initiates work. It begins with them clearly communicating their plans and policies to their staff. Without the 
        initiation of the work, no goals can be achieved.

        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        In order for the work to be completed on time and to a high standard, motivation is required, and that comes from leadership. By 
        effectively motivating the employees with both economic as well as non-economic rewards, the work will be carried out by happy and 
        incentivised employees.

        <h4>Guidance</h4>
        Sometimes employees will need a helping hand. This is where a manager can demonstrate their skills by providing helpful guidance, which 
        will show employees the way they need to perform the work both efficiently and effectively.

        <h4>Confidence</h4>
        Confidence is often overlooked but it can be vital when it comes to a business achieving its goals. Good leaders are able to explain 
        their employees' roles to them, giving them clear parameters and guidelines, which they can work within to achieve their goals. An 
        employee who is clear on their position and role will be able to develop confidence and work effectively towards completing all of 
        their tasks.
        
        <h4>Building morale</h4>
        Good morale, which once again comes from leadership, will lead to willing co-operation from the employees towards their tasks. It will 
        also help you to win their trust. A manager who is able to boost morale will be well positioned to achieve full co-operation from staff.

        <h4>Work environment</h4>
        Management is all about getting things done. An efficient and pleasant work environment will help encourage growth. Achieving a good 
        working environment comes from a leader who is able to treat their employees like humans. Reconciling personal interests of the employees 
        with the organisation's goals is an effective way to deliver long-term achievements whilst allowing your employees to grow within their 
        role.

        <h3>Leadership skills for managers</h3>
        Now that we've established what leadership is and why it's so important to management, let's take a look at some of the leadership skills 
        for managers that are required in order to get the most out of your staff and set your business on its way towards achieving its goals and 
        reaching its vision.

        <h4>Honesty and integrity</h4>
        When it comes to leadership, honesty is about being transparent and open. You need to be willing to communicate your thoughts and feelings, 
        even if what you're saying is unpopular or uncomfortable. It also means keeping your word as well as following through on any promises you 
        make.<br><br>

        Integrity, on the other hand, goes hand in hand with work ethic and having a good work ethic sets an example. If you always make the effort 
        to make the best possible decisions both in the interest of your company and your staff, employees will look at you as a leader with 
        integrity.

        <h4>Problem solving</h4>
        A lot of people believe that problem solving is fixing an error irrespective of the cost. In actual fact, many leaders will tell you that a 
        problem could end up being an opportunity, and effective problem solving is about embracing that fact. It's also about avoiding finger-pointing 
        at all costs; if a problem emerges, it's vital that you don't get caught up trying to blame someone. It's unproductive, wastes time and doesn't 
        solve the issue.<br><br>

        Instead, it's important to look at things in an analytical way. Collecting data is always an effective method when it comes to getting through 
        problems. It avoids having to rely on guesswork and will help you to ensure the problem doesn't happen again. Above all else, it's important 
        that a manager stays positive during a problem. Reacting negatively will impact morale and create panic.

        <h4>Delegate work to team members' strengths</h4>
        Recognising your team members' strengths will help create a positive workplace environment and ensure tasks get completed in a timely manner. 
        If possible, carry out either a formal or informal strengths assessment. You can assess the strengths of a team member through observation or 
        even through an interview. Alternatively, you can use a more formal method such as a strength-based questionnaire.

        <h4>Communicate powerfully and prolifically</h4>
        Perhaps the most important aspect of being a leader is communication. You can be incredibly innovative and technically gifted but if you lack 
        the skills in order to effectively communicate your ideas and methods, they will struggle to get off the ground.

        Essentially, powerful communication will help you to influence as well as inspire your team. In order to do that, there are three tools you will
        need to master:
        <ul>
            <li>Active listening</li>
            <li>Creative questioning</li>
            <li>Responding influentially</li>
        </ul>

        Active listening will give you a greater understanding and awareness of any given situation, and the same can be said for creative questioning. 
        Responding in an influential way will help you to convey effective words and messages which will inspire your team.<br><br>

        It can take time, and linking listening, questioning and messaging requires delicate and careful skills. Once you get it right, however, your 
        conversations will be infinitely more constructive and will lead to more successful meetings.

        <h4>Collaborate and promote teamwork</h4>
        Promoting teamwork wherever possible will help your team work more cohesively towards the company's vision. A good way to achieve teamwork is 
        through meetings and assigning tasks that require your team to communicate with each other as well as form trust and be able to support each other.<br><br>

        Once the task has been completed, team members will have added respect for each other and value other members' roles. It may also work if you 
        provide incentives or rewards for fulfilling the tasks as this could help to motivate them even more.

        <h4>Drive for results</h4>
        A leader is always looking to drive results, but this shouldn't come at the cost of employee engagement. One method effective managers employ for 
        driving results is by giving their employees accountability. When you make your people accountable for their own work, results and decisions, the 
        effectiveness of an organisation will generally increase greatly.<br><br>

        In order to drive results, it's also vital that all decisions are well thought out. By simply aligning your decisions with your values and by 
        including your team in the decision-making process, you can transform results into a set of goals which is shared.<br><br>
