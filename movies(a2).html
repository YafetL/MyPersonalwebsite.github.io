        Following a resource crisis and subsequent wars, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max Rockatansky, a survivor 
        haunted by visions of his deceased family, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a 
        universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a "blood bag" for a sick War Boy called Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's lieutenants, 
        is sent in her armoured semi-truck, the "War Rig", to collect gasoline and ammunition. When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives—women 
        selected for breeding—are missing, and are fleeing with her. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and 
        the Bullet Farm.<br><br>

        Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a battle ensues between the War Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into a sand storm, evading 
        her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, 
        Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by the wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag, and the Splendid Angharad, who is heavily pregnant with 
        Joe's child. Max steals the Rig, but Furiosa activates a kill switch to disable it. As Furiosa is the only one who knows the correct combination to restart 
        the Rig, Max reluctantly agrees to let her and the wives accompany him; Nux climbs on the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa, but is overcome 
        and thrown out, and is picked up by Joe's army.<br><br>

        Furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon, having bartered a deal for safe passage. However, with Joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, 
        forcing her and the group to flee, while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joe's car, with Nux now 
        on board, breaks through the blockade and eventually attacks the War Rig, allowing Nux to board and once again attempts to attack Furiosa, but fails and falls 
        to the disappointment of Joe. However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad also falls off trying to help Max and is run over by Joe's car, killing her and her child. 
        Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the "Green Place", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, 
        distraught over his failure, and consoles him. That night, the Rig gets stuck in mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with mines, but Joe's ally, the Bullet 
        Farmer, continues pursuing them. Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet 
        Farmer and his men, wordlessly returning with guns and ammunition and covered in blood.<br><br>

        They drive the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. Max suspects a trap, though Furiosa approaches the woman 
        and states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognize Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. 
        Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense 
        salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of the child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the 
        undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and to trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon.<br><br>

        The group heads back towards the Citadel, but Joe's forces attack them en route, seriously wounding Furiosa. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, 
        while Max fights Joe's giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract him long enough for Furiosa to kill him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking 
        the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving Vuvalini to escape in Joe's car, where Max transfuses his blood to 
        Furiosa, saving her life.<br><br>

        At the Citadel, the impoverished citizens react to Joe's death with joy. Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the remaining War Boys. 
        Max shares a respectful glance with Furiosa before blending into the crowd and departing for parts unknown.<br><br>
