            <h1>Horrible bosses</h1>
            <img src="./asset/image/Horrible_Bosses.jpg" alt="Profile image"><br><br>
            <big>
                Nick Hendricks and Dale Arbus are friends who despise their bosses. Nick works at Comnidyne, a financial firm for the sadistic 
                David Harken, who hints at a possible promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant 
                being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris; she threatens to tell his fiancée Stacy that he had sex with her unless 
                he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman enjoys working for Jack Pellit at a chemical company,
                but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby, whose apathy 
                and incompetence threaten the future of the company.<br><br>

                At night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around. Initially 
                hesitant, they eventually agree to kill their employers. In search of a hitman, the trio meet Dean "Muthafuckah" Jones, an ex-con 
                who agrees to be their "murder consultant." Jones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other's bosses to hide their motive 
                while making the deaths look like accidents.<br><br>

                The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals his phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while 
                Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter 
                on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with 
                Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex 
                with him. Nick and Dale wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone 
                in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, while 
                Nick secretly witnesses the murder.<br><br>

                Nick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. 
                They are questioned by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police 
                are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been 
                imprisoned for bootlegging a film. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash 
                Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio 
                recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but 
                Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely 
                disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to 
                frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness.<br><br>

                The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator, Gregory, reveals that it is his company's policy to record all 
                conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing he murdered Bobby. Harken is sentenced to 25 years 
                to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company but under a sadistic CEO, Kurt 
                retains his job but also under a new boss, and Dale, with the help of Jones, blackmails Julia into ending her harassment.<br><br>

                <h1>Game night</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/Game_night.png" alt=""><br><br>
                Married competitive gamer couple Max and Annie are trying to have a child, but their attempts are unsuccessful due to Max's stress surrounding 
                is feelings of inadequacy when compared to his successful, attractive brother Brooks. During Max and Annie's routine weekend game night with 
                their friends Ryan, and married couple Kevin and Michelle, Brooks shows up Max by arriving in a Corvette Stingray (Max's dream car) and sharing 
                an embarrassing childhood story about Max to throw Max off during a game. Brooks offers to host the next game night at a house he is renting while
                he is in town. Meanwhile, Max and Annie are trying to keep their game nights secret from their neighbor Gary, an awkward police officer left 
                distraught after his divorce from their old friend Debbie, who has since moved away.<br><br>

                When the guests, including Ryan's new date, Sarah, arrive at Brooks' house the following week, Brooks says he has initiated an interactive 
                role-playing mystery game, promising the winner his Stingray. A man dressed as an FBI agent bursts into the home and informs them of the 
                narrative of the mystery, only for two masked men to break in and assault him and Brooks. The guests believe the assault is part of the game, 
                so they just watch and comment on the struggle. After Brooks is dragged out of the house, the couples begin to solve the mystery using the 
                clues left behind by the actor.<br><br>

                Using his GPS location, Max and Annie track Brooks down to a seedy bar and, using a pistol left behind by Brooks during the struggle (which 
                they believe to be fake), manage to take the keys to the storage closet, where Brooks is being held. After Annie mistakenly fires the gun 
                and shoots Max in the arm, confirming the weapon is real and that they are in actual danger, the three escape. Brooks admits that he 
                actually makes his living buying and selling illegal items on the black market, in particular a Fabergé egg sought by a man known only as 
                "the Bulgarian" and owned by a man using the alias Marlon Freeman. With his captors in pursuit, Brooks exits the moving car to guarantee Max
                and Annie's escape.<br><br>

                Eventually, the others learn what they have become involved in, avoiding police because of Brooks' warnings about the Bulgarian 
                having moles in the government. Trying to determine the identities of the Bulgarian and Marlon Freeman, they show up at Gary's 
                house, under the false pretense of a game night, in order to use his police computer, where Max discovers the address of Marlon 
                Freeman (real name: Donald Anderton). The group leaves Gary's house and arrives at Anderton's address, where he is hosting an 
                underground fight club. As the others search the house, Ryan spots the egg in a wall safe and is caught trying to steal it. 
                The group escapes with the egg, but accidentally break it. They discover the egg is a worthless fake, but end up finding a 
                list of names that was stored inside of it, realizing this was what the Bulgarian wanted.<br><br>

                The group finds Brooks and his captors on an under-construction bridge and move in to rescue him. Before the captors are able 
                to kill them, the group is saved by Gary, who is then shot in the chest. Max and Annie try to encourage him to pull through by 
                promising to invite him to every future game night. Gary then reveals that he faked the entire scenario in an attempt to trick 
                them into letting him join game night again. He is, however, unaware of the egg, and they are immediately attacked by the real 
                Bulgarian, who captures Brooks after he swallows the list, revealed to be people in the witness protection program. Max and 
                Annie use Brooks' Corvette to drive to the airport and stop the Bulgarian from taking off with Brooks in his jet. They 
                eventually knock the Bulgarian out and dispatch his henchmen, tie him up, and free Brooks.<br><br>

                Three months later, Brooks, now under house arrest for his crimes, has managed to sell the list for $3 million (having also tipped 
                off the witnesses for $20 thousand each). Meanwhile, Annie has finally become pregnant. While the group (including an inept Gary) 
                are continuing their game night, men with guns get ready to storm the building.<br><br>

                Mid-credits, Gary's intricate plan for his re-institution into game night is shown. He has collected a series of ID cards featuring 
                the friend group, one of which shows that Ryan is a Harvard alumnus (though it isn't clear whether he had graduated or was kicked out). 
                A running joke through the film is that Michelle had sex with someone whom she thought was Denzel Washington. A post-credits scene shows 
                a flashback of Gary's ex-wife Debbie meeting Kenny (not Denzel) at a gas station.<br><br>

                <h1>2 Guns</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/2_guns.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                Criminals Robert "Bobby" Beans (Denzel Washington) and Michael "Stig" Stigman (Mark Wahlberg) are questioned by the United States Border 
                Patrol after a meeting with drug lord Manny "Papi" Greco (Edward James Olmos) in Mexico. Unknown to Stig, Bobby is an undercover DEA agent 
                named Bobby Trench and reports to his superior, Jessup (Robert John Burke), that he failed to acquire cocaine from Papi that they could use 
                as evidence to convict him.<br><br>

                Against Jessup's orders, Bobby decides to remain undercover and assist Stig in robbing $3 million - stashed in the vault of the Tres Cruces 
                bank - from Papi, so they can prosecute Papi for money laundering. Bobby has a rendezvous with fellow DEA agent and former lover, Deb Rees 
                (Paula Patton), who is also seeing another man, while Stig, an undercover enlisted Intelligence Specialist with the Navy SEALs, meets with 
                his commanding officer, LCDR Harold Quince (James Marsden), who instructs Stig to kill Bobby so the Navy can use the stolen money to fund 
                unauthorized covert operations.<br><br>

                During the heist, Bobby and Stig are surprised to find $43.125 million in the vault instead of the expected $3M. After the heist, Stig follows 
                orders to betray Bobby and escape with the money, managing to pull his gun right as Bobby is about to pull his own. Unwilling to kill Bobby,
                Stig wounds Bobby in the shoulder, and then sees Bobby's DEA badge. Not sure what to think of Bobby, he leaves Bobby behind in the desert 
                and leaves with the money. Stig meets with Quince, and after learning what happened, Quince attempts to have Stig killed. Stig escapes 
                after learning the money will be transferred to a Navy base in Corpus Christi. Meanwhile, a man named Earl (Bill Paxton) aggressively 
                interrogates the Tres Cruces bank manager about the stolen money and also questions the vet who treated Bobby's wounds as he tracks 
                Bobby's movements.<br><br>

                However, Bobby goes to Stig's apartment to find out where he took the money, only to have Stig contact him from a sniper's post across the 
                street. A hit squad sent by Quince attacks the apartment but Bobby and Stig escape. Bobby visits Jessup to tell him what happened, but Earl 
                and his men are there waiting for him. Earl kills Jessup, frames Bobby for the murder and lets him go, making a deal that if Bobby returns 
                the $43 million he will be cleared.<br><br>

                Bobby and Stig kidnap Papi and interrogate him in the garage at Deb's house. They find out Earl is a black ops operative to whom Papi reports, 
                and that the money they stole was from payments to the CIA. The CIA has strong armed Papi, as well as other cartels, into paying a 7% cut in
                exchange for using CIA planes to help smuggle product across the Border. The garage is attacked by another hit squad, led by Quince. Bobby,
                Stig, and Deb escape, but so does Papi, who calls his crew. All three end up being captured by Papi, and taken to his farm in Mexico. After
                beating them and receiving a visit from Earl, Papi gives the pair 24 hours to steal the money from the Navy and return it to him, or Deb 
                will die.<br><br>

                At the base, Bobby infiltrates Quince's office, only to discover Quince is Deb's boyfriend, and they had planned to steal the money for themselves. 
                Meanwhile, Stig asks Admiral Tuway (Fred Ward) for help. Tuway orders Quince's arrest, but disavows Stig to prevent the scandal from tarnishing the 
                Navy's reputation. Quince evades arrest, as does Stig. Unable to find the money, Bobby is too late to prevent Papi from killing Deb. He later realizes 
                that the money is in a motel room that he and Deb frequented and goes to help Stig, who had returned to Papi's farm alone to exact vengeance.<br><br>

                There, Stig is surrounded by Papi's men until both Quince and Earl intervene. Bobby arrives in a car filled with money, and then blows up the car, 
                scattering the money everywhere, which leads to a massive shootout. During a standoff among Quince, Earl, Bobby, and Stig, Earl reveals that the CIA 
                has 20 other secret banks, and the loss of the $43.125 million is only a minor setback. Signaling Stig with a phrase from an earlier conversation, 
                Stig shoots Earl, and Bobby shoots Quince. Bobby and Stig kill Papi and the duo escapes, but not before Bobby shoots Stig in the leg as payback for 
                shooting him in the desert. While planning to continue to take down the CIA's secret banks and sabotage their black operations, Bobby reveals to Stig 
                that he did not blow up all the money and had some stashed away.<br><br>

                <h1>Mad Max Fury Road</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/Mad_Max_Fury_Road.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                Following a resource crisis and subsequent wars, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max Rockatansky, a survivor 
                haunted by visions of his deceased family, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joe's Citadel. Designated a 
                universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a "blood bag" for a sick War Boy called Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joe's lieutenants, 
                is sent in her armoured semi-truck, the "War Rig", to collect gasoline and ammunition. When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives—women 
                selected for breeding—are missing, and are fleeing with her. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and 
                the Bullet Farm.<br><br>

                Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a battle ensues between the War Rig and Joe's forces. Furiosa drives into a sand storm, evading 
                her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, 
                Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by the wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag, and the Splendid Angharad, who is heavily pregnant with 
                Joe's child. Max steals the Rig, but Furiosa activates a kill switch to disable it. As Furiosa is the only one who knows the correct combination to restart 
                the Rig, Max reluctantly agrees to let her and the wives accompany him; Nux climbs on the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa, but is overcome 
                and thrown out, and is picked up by Joe's army.<br><br>

                Furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon, having bartered a deal for safe passage. However, with Joe's forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, 
                forcing her and the group to flee, while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joe's car, with Nux now 
                on board, breaks through the blockade and eventually attacks the War Rig, allowing Nux to board and once again attempts to attack Furiosa, but fails and falls 
                to the disappointment of Joe. However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad also falls off trying to help Max and is run over by Joe's car, killing her and her child. 
                Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the "Green Place", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, 
                distraught over his failure, and consoles him. That night, the Rig gets stuck in mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joe's forces with mines, but Joe's ally, the Bullet 
                Farmer, continues pursuing them. Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet 
                Farmer and his men, wordlessly returning with guns and ammunition and covered in blood.<br><br>

                They drive the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. Max suspects a trap, though Furiosa approaches the woman 
                and states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognize Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. 
                Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense 
                salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of the child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the 
                undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and to trap Joe and his army in the bikers' canyon.<br><br>

                The group heads back towards the Citadel, but Joe's forces attack them en route, seriously wounding Furiosa. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, 
                while Max fights Joe's giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract him long enough for Furiosa to kill him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking 
                the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving Vuvalini to escape in Joe's car, where Max transfuses his blood to 
                Furiosa, saving her life.<br><br>

                At the Citadel, the impoverished citizens react to Joe's death with joy. Furiosa, the wives, and the Vuvalini are cheered by the people and welcomed by the remaining War Boys. 
                Max shares a respectful glance with Furiosa before blending into the crowd and departing for parts unknown.<br><br>
                <h1>Five Feet Apart</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/Five_Feet_Apart.webp" alt=""><br><br>

                Stella Grant is a cystic fibrosis patient who actively uses social media to cope with her illness and tries to live a normal life. She meets another CF patient, William "Will" 
                Newman, who is at the hospital for a medication trial, in an attempt to get rid of the bacterial infection (B. cepacia) he has in his lungs.<br><br>

                CF patients are strictly kept six feet apart to reduce the risk of cross-infection, as contracting bacterial infections from other CF patients can be dangerous, even 
                life-threatening. Stella is determined to follow the rules, and initially dislikes Will, who likes to break the rules and take dangerous risks sometimes. Stella notices 
                that Will isn't strictly following his treatment regimen and eventually gets him to agree to do so.<br><br>

                Will and Stella begin to fall for each other and secretly go on their first date, eventually ending up at the hospital pool, where they strip to reveal scars from their past 
                surgeries. The next day is Will's birthday and Stella throws him a surprise dinner party with the help of Poe, Stella's best friend and a fellow CF patient.<br><br>

                Sometime thereafter, Poe dies and Stella is ashamed that she never got to hug him. Heartbroken, Stella decides that she is living her life too strictly and convinces Will 
                to leave the hospital with her in order to view the lights from the city. As they walk, Stella suddenly grabs Will's hand, scaring Will however Stella justifies that she 
                has gloves on. They come across a pond and slide around on the frozen surface. Meanwhile, the hospital is notified that a lung transplant is available for Stella, who ignores 
                alerts about it in order to spend more time out with Will.<br><br>

                When Will discovers this, he pleads with Stella to take the transplant. Stella refuses, before falling through the ice. Will is able to pull her out of the water, but Stella is 
                unresponsive. Despite the risk of infection, Will performs CPR and Stella wakes up. They are then brought back to the hospital by ambulance. Though hesitant at first, Stella 
                agrees to do the transplant after Will convinces her to do it for him. The transplant is successful, and Will learns that Stella did not contract his infection.<br><br>

                When Stella wakes up from her surgery, she sees Will through the glass of her room. He has setup a display of lights outside of her room, saying that his only regret was that she 
                did not get to see the lights so he brought them to her. He tells her that his drug trial isn't working, and he doesn't want her to have to deal with his eventual death. Confessing 
                his love for her, Will makes her close her eyes, because he says he won't be able to leave if she is looking at him. Stella closes her eyes and Will walks away.<br><br>

                <h1>About Time</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/About_Time.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) grows up in Cornwall in a house by the sea with his father James (Bill Nighy), mother Mary (Lindsay Duncan), absent-minded uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery), 
                and free-spirited sister Katherine or "Kit Kat" (Lydia Wilson). At the age of 21, Tim learns from his father that the men of his family have the secret ability to travel back in time, 
                to moments they have lived before. In order to time travel they must be in a dark space, clench their fists and visualize the memory they wish to travel back to. James discourages his 
                son from using his gift to acquire money or fame, and Tim decides he will use it to improve his love life.<br><br>

                The following summer, Kit Kat's friend Charlotte (Margot Robbie) visits. Tim is instantly smitten, but waits until the end of her stay to tell her how he feels; she tells him that he 
                should have told her earlier. Tim travels back in time to tell Charlotte in the middle of the holiday, but she says it would be better to wait until her last day. Heartbroken, Tim 
                realizes she is uninterested in him, and that time travel cannot change anyone's mind.<br><br>

                Tim moves to London to pursue a career as a lawyer, living with his father's acquaintance, Harry (Tom Hollander), an angry misanthropic playwright. Tim visits a Dans le Noir restaurant, 
                where he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams). They flirt in the darkness, and afterward, Mary gives Tim her phone number. Tim returns home to find a distraught Harry, whose opening night of new 
                play has been ruined by an actor forgetting his lines. Tim goes back in time to put things right, and the play is a triumph.<br><br>

                However, later, when Tim tries to call Mary, he discovers that by going back in time to help Harry, the evening with Mary never occurred. He recalls Mary's obsession with Kate Moss, and, 
                through sheer persistence, finds Mary a week later at a Kate Moss exhibition. Unfortunately, he discovers that she now has a boyfriend. Tim finds out when and where they met (at a party). 
                He turns up early, before the potential boyfriend arrives, and persuades Mary to leave with him instead. Their relationship develops, and Tim moves in with Mary. One night, he encounters 
                Charlotte who now seems interested in him, but Tim turns her down, realizing that he is in love with Mary. He proposes; they marry and, fairly soon, have a daughter they name Posy.<br><br>

                Kit Kat's difficulties in life and her drinking lead her to crash her car on Posy's first birthday. As Kit Kat recovers, Tim decides to intervene in her life: he prevents the crash and 
                takes Kit Kat back in time to avert her unhappy relationship with Jimmy (Tom Hughes). They manage to return to the present, where Tim finds Posy has never been born and he has a son 
                instead. James explains that they cannot change events prior to their children's birth and ensure that exact child will still be conceived. Tim accepts that he cannot change his sister's 
                life by changing her past; he allows the crash to occur, ensuring Posy's birth, and he and Mary help Kit Kat improve her own life. She settles down with Tim's friend Jay and has a child 
                of her own. Tim and Mary have another child, a baby boy.<br><br>

                Tim learns his father has terminal cancer that time travel cannot change. His father has known for some time, but kept traveling back in time to effectively extend his life and spend more 
                time with his family. He tells Tim to live each day twice in order to be truly happy: first, with all the everyday tensions and worries, but the second time noticing how sweet the world 
                can be. Tim follows this advice; his father dies, but Tim travels to the past to visit whenever he misses him.<br><br>

                Mary tells Tim she wants a third child. He is reluctant because it means he will not be able to visit his father again. Tim tells his father that he cannot visit any more, and together they 
                travel back to relive a fond memory from Tim's early childhood. Mary gives birth to a baby girl, and Tim knows he can never see his father again. Tim comes to realize that it is better to live 
                each day once, and appreciate life with his family as if he is living it for the second time.<br><br>
