                <h1>How to Use Your Body to Calm Your Brain</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/yoga.jfif"><br><br>
                You know that your brain controls your body, but did you know that your body also controls your brain? It’s a feedback loop that 
                works both ways. The activity in your brain changes every second based on what your body is doing. This process is called 
                biofeedback.<br><br>

                You may have thought that biofeedback required equipment, like a finger heart rate monitor or software. While technology can 
                make measuring bodily changes easier, it’s not necessary. You can alter your brain’s function with conscious biofeedback simply 
                by paying attention. For example, slowing your breathing or relaxing specific muscles can directly impact your thoughts, feelings, 
                emotions, and stress levels.<br><br>

                Your brain is perfectly equipped to notice what’s going on with your body — heart rate, breathing, muscle tension, sweating. 
                In fact, it’s doing it all the time anyway. You just have to notice it. To practice conscious biofeedback, you have to become 
                aware and guide the process.<br><br>

                Now a days, we have equipments and a neurofeedback therapy to calming the mind.However, you don’t need any equipment to successfully 
                use your body to calm your brain or to stimulate your vagus nerve. You just have to become aware of and influence your body through 
                your own actions. Some ways to do this are:

                <h4>Splash cold water on your face</h4>
                Rinsing your face with cold water stimulates your vagus nerve. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stressed or anxious try filling 
                a sink with cool water and splashing your face. If you’re up for it, a cold shower or anything that exposes your body to cold 
                also does the trick.

                <h4>Use the power of music</h4>
                Music has been shown to increase or decrease HRV. While just listening to music works, making music has an even greater positive 
                effect.  Music engages most of your brain and limbic system, which largely governs emotions.

                <h4>Smile</h4>
                It’s a simple thing to do and really can improve your mood. Even a fake smile causes your brain to release dopamine. Think of a 
                fun time, a silly situation or your favorite joke. In your brain, there’s not much difference between forced and spontaneous 
                smiling.

                <h4></h4>Stand up straight</h4>
                Studies have shown that standing up straight in a more confident posture makes you feel more decisive and confident in your own 
                thoughts and beliefs, and confident postures also correlated with being more optimistic. Posture is an important source of feedback 
                for your brain. One study even showed that standing up straighter increases strength. Sitting straighter has similar effects.

                <h4>Calm your face</h4>
                There’s a muscle in the middle of your forehead in between your eyebrows, called the corrugator supercilii. It pulls your 
                eyebrows down and together, causing your forehead to wrinkle. In the same way your brain thinks you’re happy when you smile, 
                if your brow is furrowed and this muscle is tense, your brain interprets it as you being worried or upset. On bright days, 
                wearing sunglasses will reduce squinting and relax this muscle making your brain feel calmer.

                <h4>Relax your jaw and tongue</h4> 
                When you’re stressed, you tend to clench your teeth and tense your tongue. However, when you consciously loosen your jaw, your 
                brain relaxes too. You can wiggle it around and open your mouth wide. Make it a point to relax your tongue which also calms 
                your mind.

                <h4>Change your breathing</h4>
                Relaxed breathing slows your heart rate and activates the calm, parasympathetic nervous system. There are many breathing 
                techniques that calm your brain and body instantly. Conversely, breathe faster, and you will create more energy.

                <h4>Clench and relax</h4>
                Sometimes it’s actually helpful to clench your muscles and relax them to fully know the difference. Take a deep breath and 
                intentionally flex a tense muscle for a few seconds. After holding it, exhale and relax the muscle. The most important muscles 
                to relax are in your face. However,  don’t forget your hands, neck, shoulders, butt, back, and stomach. We do this in yoga. 
                It works!

                <h1>How Music Helps Your Mental Health</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/music.jpg"><br><br>
                There are very few things that stimulate the brain in the way it does. It’s one of the most demanding cognitive and neural 
                challenging activities. Music requires complex and accurate timing of multiple actions in your brain because of the structural, 
                mathematical, and architectural relationships between the notes. Although it may not feel like it, your brain is doing a lot of 
                computing to make sense of all the incoming stimuli. It’s one of the few activities that activate almost every part of your brain.<br><br>

                The effects of music are cognitive, psychological, social, behavioral, and emotional.<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music" target="blanck">Research</a>  has shown that listening to musical 
                pieces can reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and pain as well as improve sleep quality, mood, mental alertness, and memory. Active 
                engagement with music has lasting brain benefits, such as improving concentration, memory, self-discipline, and confidence.  The 
                cognitive benefits of music education extend from early childhood to old age. Some studies show that it can make you smarter. It 
                may even help ward off the effects of brain aging.

                <h2>Music’s Mental Health Benefits</h2>
                <h4>Reduces Stress</h4>
                Research shows that listening to certain melodies can lower the stress hormone, cortisol. In one study reviewed, patients 
                about to undergo surgery who listened to music had less anxiety and lower cortisol levels than people who had taken drugs.<br><br>

                Listening to music triggers the brain’s nucleus accumbens, responsible for releasing the feel-good neurochemical dopamine, 
                which is an integral part of the pleasure-reward and motivational systems and plays a critical role in learning. Higher 
                dopamine levels improve concentration, boost mood, and enhance memory. Dopamine is the chemical responsible for the yummy 
                feelings you get from eating chocolate, having an orgasm, or a runner’s high.

                <h4>Decreases Depression</h4>
                Science shows that music can help alleviate depression and help a person feel more hopeful and in control of their life. 
                There is even evidence that listening to music can aid in rewiring trauma in the brain. Creating harmonies with others or 
                enjoying live music, like at a concert, gets the brain hormone oxytocin flowing increasing feelings of connectedness, trust, 
                and social bonding.<br><br>

                A study appearing in the World Journal of Psychiatry found that musical therapy successfully reduced depression and anxiety 
                in patients suffering from neurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. Researchers also noted 
                that the therapy had no negative side effects and was a safe, low-risk treatment tool. Other research showed that musical 
                therapy significantly improved depressive symptoms.

                <h2>How Music Helps Your Mental Health</h2>
                <h4>Boosts Mood</h4>
                One study found that people who listened to upbeat tunes could improve their mood and boost happiness levels in just two weeks. 
                In the experiment, one group was instructed to try to improve their mood with music. The other participants were told to listen 
                to music but were not guided to try to intentionally elevate their mood. When participants were later asked to describe their 
                happiness levels, those who had purposefully tried to improve their moods reported feeling happier after just two weeks.<br><br>

                Not surprisingly, another study found that different types of music had different effects on mood. Researchers determined that 
                classical and meditation scores offered the greatest mood-boosting benefits. Heavy metal and techno were found to be ineffective 
                and in some cases, detrimental. Surprisingly though, even sad music can bring most listeners pleasure and comfort, according to 
                one study.<br><br>

                While listening to music can bring multiple mental and physical health benefits, creating it can be therapy, too. Singing in a 
                choir has many mood-boosting and mental health benefits. Of course, playing a musical instrument has advantages for both your 
                mental wellbeing and physical brain health.

                <h4>Increases Motivation and Enhances </h4>
                There’s a good reason why exercise classes blast the beats or runners have tunes playing in their earbuds. Research shows that 
                listening to fast-paced music motivates people to work out harder.<br><br>

                In one experiment, 12 healthy male students pedaled stationary bikes. The participants rode for 25 minutes in three sessions and 
                listened to six songs. Unbeknownst to the bikers, the researchers were altering the tempos and measuring performances. For example, 
                the songs were played at a normal speed, increased by ten percent, or slowed by ten percent.<br><br>

                The researchers discovered that speeding up the tracks resulted in increased performance in terms of distance covered, the speed 
                of pedaling, and power exerted. Interestingly, listening to faster-paced songs not only caused exercisers to work harder during 
                their workouts; they also reported enjoying the music more. Conversely, slowing down the tempo led to decreases in all of the 
                variables.

                <h4>Strengthens Social Bonds</h4>
                In a 2013 review of the research on music, Stefan Koelsch, a music psychologist at the Freie University Berlin, determined the 
                mechanisms through which music allows us to connect with one another. It impacts brain circuits involved in empathy, trust, and 
                cooperation. This might explain how it has survived in every culture of the world. Music is one of the few activities where people 
                around the globe respond in a common way. It connects all kinds of people across a myriad of cultures, traditions, and practices all 
                over the world.<br><br>
