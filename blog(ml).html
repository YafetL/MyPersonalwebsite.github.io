            <h1>Management and Leadership</h1>
            <big>
                <h1>Manager vs Leader. Who are You?</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/M vs L.jpg"><br><br>
                Did you know that actually there are lots of differences between a manager and a leader? These differences are quite crucial 
                and predefine the group of people you belong to. If you are not sure what type of a person you are or want to be, this 
                article might help you.<br><br>

                At the first sight, it may seem that all managers should be leaders or that all leaders should always be in top management 
                positions or somewhat similar. However, this is not always true. Sometimes, the head of an organization, CEO or even a president 
                is not a leader. Does this sound confusing? Let’s go ahead and dive into this stuff deeper.<br><br>

                A manager is someone who plans, delegates and controls the usage and coordination of team resources and project activities in 
                order to achieve certain goals in conjunction with five functions of management: planning, organizing, staffing, leading and 
                controlling. Managers always push people to set and achieve goals.<br><br>

                A leader is someone with his own vision and interpersonal skills. Leaders always guide, influence and coach people. They follow 
                the direction of a team in order to set and achieve goals. Leadership is more like influencing, inspiring and motivating employees 
                to set and achieve goals and to be a part of a certain process.<br><br>

                We may say that managers are mostly focused on things, they push and direct. Whereas leaders focus on people and their development, 
                they pull and influence. So when answering the main question of this article I can say that every person can be either a leader or 
                a manager as well as both at the same time, but that takes a totally different set of skills.<br><br>

                In my humble opinion, today’s world is full of managers, while leaders are truly hard to find as it takes a person to possess a whole 
                set of interpersonal skills like the ability to motivate, to influence, to inspire, and pull people forward. Not all managers can be 
                leaders as well as not all leaders can be managers. Some leaders may strongly dislike administrative work and see it as super boring 
                and routine. So, where do we find leaders?<br><br>

                Leaders can be found at any part of the organization. Not all of them are working at top positions, as managers can brilliantly lead 
                companies without being leaders. Other organizations are governed by leaders who have a great team of managers doing all the 
                administrative work and carrying out the management functions.<br><br>

                Here is a comparative list showcasing major similarities and differences between leaders and managers:<br><br>
                <strong> A manager:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>is a part of the formal process;</li>
                    <li>is involved in a process;</li>
                    <li>pushes people who need to be a part of the organization;</li>
                    <li>solves problems and drives change;</li>
                    <li>pushes people.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong> A leader:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>is not a part of the formal organization;</li>
                    <li>leads by influence with or without power;</li>
                    <li>has a group of people who want to follow him;</li>
                    <li>leads change and influences people;</li>
                    <li>motivates and creates momentum.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong> Major commonalities between leaders and managers are as follows:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>both have a vision;</li>
                    <li>are responsible for setting and achieving goals;</li>
                    <li>are responsible for achieving results;</li>
                    <li>are responsible for continuous improvement of the process they are involved in;</li>
                    <li>have followers they need to listen to.</li>
                </ul>
                To sum it up, I can say that organizations need both leaders and managers to perform successfully and assure continuous process of 
                development and innovation. Combining both managerial and leading skills can be quite challenging but it is never too late to try 
                to learn something new and become a better person with new valuable skills and abilities.

                <h1>Why is leadership important for managers?</h1>
                <img src="./asset/image/manager.jfif"><br><br>
                Leadership is perhaps the most important function of management - it helps to maximise efficiency which can help to achieve the overall 
                vision and goals of the business. Here are some points that justify why leadership is so important in regard to management.

                <h4>Initiates action</h4>
                A leader is someone who initiates work. It begins with them clearly communicating their plans and policies to their staff. Without the 
                initiation of the work, no goals can be achieved.

                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                In order for the work to be completed on time and to a high standard, motivation is required, and that comes from leadership. By 
                effectively motivating the employees with both economic as well as non-economic rewards, the work will be carried out by happy and 
                incentivised employees.

                <h4>Guidance</h4>
                Sometimes employees will need a helping hand. This is where a manager can demonstrate their skills by providing helpful guidance, which 
                will show employees the way they need to perform the work both efficiently and effectively.

                <h4>Confidence</h4>
                Confidence is often overlooked but it can be vital when it comes to a business achieving its goals. Good leaders are able to explain 
                their employees' roles to them, giving them clear parameters and guidelines, which they can work within to achieve their goals. An 
                employee who is clear on their position and role will be able to develop confidence and work effectively towards completing all of 
                their tasks.
                
                <h4>Building morale</h4>
                Good morale, which once again comes from leadership, will lead to willing co-operation from the employees towards their tasks. It will 
                also help you to win their trust. A manager who is able to boost morale will be well positioned to achieve full co-operation from staff.

                <h4>Work environment</h4>
                Management is all about getting things done. An efficient and pleasant work environment will help encourage growth. Achieving a good 
                working environment comes from a leader who is able to treat their employees like humans. Reconciling personal interests of the employees 
                with the organisation's goals is an effective way to deliver long-term achievements whilst allowing your employees to grow within their 
                role.

                <h3>Leadership skills for managers</h3>
                Now that we've established what leadership is and why it's so important to management, let's take a look at some of the leadership skills 
                for managers that are required in order to get the most out of your staff and set your business on its way towards achieving its goals and 
                reaching its vision.

                <h4>Honesty and integrity</h4>
                When it comes to leadership, honesty is about being transparent and open. You need to be willing to communicate your thoughts and feelings, 
                even if what you're saying is unpopular or uncomfortable. It also means keeping your word as well as following through on any promises you 
                make.<br><br>

                Integrity, on the other hand, goes hand in hand with work ethic and having a good work ethic sets an example. If you always make the effort 
                to make the best possible decisions both in the interest of your company and your staff, employees will look at you as a leader with 
                integrity.

                <h4>Problem solving</h4>
                A lot of people believe that problem solving is fixing an error irrespective of the cost. In actual fact, many leaders will tell you that a 
                problem could end up being an opportunity, and effective problem solving is about embracing that fact. It's also about avoiding finger-pointing 
                at all costs; if a problem emerges, it's vital that you don't get caught up trying to blame someone. It's unproductive, wastes time and doesn't 
                solve the issue.<br><br>

                Instead, it's important to look at things in an analytical way. Collecting data is always an effective method when it comes to getting through 
                problems. It avoids having to rely on guesswork and will help you to ensure the problem doesn't happen again. Above all else, it's important 
                that a manager stays positive during a problem. Reacting negatively will impact morale and create panic.

                <h4>Delegate work to team members' strengths</h4>
                Recognising your team members' strengths will help create a positive workplace environment and ensure tasks get completed in a timely manner. 
                If possible, carry out either a formal or informal strengths assessment. You can assess the strengths of a team member through observation or 
                even through an interview. Alternatively, you can use a more formal method such as a strength-based questionnaire.

                <h4>Communicate powerfully and prolifically</h4>
                Perhaps the most important aspect of being a leader is communication. You can be incredibly innovative and technically gifted but if you lack 
                the skills in order to effectively communicate your ideas and methods, they will struggle to get off the ground.

                Essentially, powerful communication will help you to influence as well as inspire your team. In order to do that, there are three tools you will
                need to master:
                <ul>
                    <li>Active listening</li>
                    <li>Creative questioning</li>
                    <li>Responding influentially</li>
                </ul>

                Active listening will give you a greater understanding and awareness of any given situation, and the same can be said for creative questioning. 
                Responding in an influential way will help you to convey effective words and messages which will inspire your team.<br><br>

                It can take time, and linking listening, questioning and messaging requires delicate and careful skills. Once you get it right, however, your 
                conversations will be infinitely more constructive and will lead to more successful meetings.

                <h4>Collaborate and promote teamwork</h4>
                Promoting teamwork wherever possible will help your team work more cohesively towards the company's vision. A good way to achieve teamwork is 
                through meetings and assigning tasks that require your team to communicate with each other as well as form trust and be able to support each other.<br><br>

                Once the task has been completed, team members will have added respect for each other and value other members' roles. It may also work if you 
                provide incentives or rewards for fulfilling the tasks as this could help to motivate them even more.

                <h4>Drive for results</h4>
                A leader is always looking to drive results, but this shouldn't come at the cost of employee engagement. One method effective managers employ for 
                driving results is by giving their employees accountability. When you make your people accountable for their own work, results and decisions, the 
                effectiveness of an organisation will generally increase greatly.<br><br>

                In order to drive results, it's also vital that all decisions are well thought out. By simply aligning your decisions with your values and by 
                including your team in the decision-making process, you can transform results into a set of goals which is shared.<br><br>
