                <h1>How to Improve Your Social Life</h1>
                <h2>6 of My Favorite Timeless Tips</h2>
                <h4>1. Be wary of building walls</h4>

                The ego wants to divide your world. It wants to create barriers, separation and loves to play the comparison game. The game where 
                people are different compared to you, the game where you are better than someone and worse than someone else. All of that creates 
                fear. And so we build walls. But putting up walls tends to in the end hurt you more than protect you.<br><br>

                So how can you start building bridges instead? One way is to choose to be curious about people. Curiosity is filled with 
                anticipation and enthusiasm. It opens you up. And when you are open and enthusiastic then you have more fun things to think 
                about than focusing on your fear.<br><br>

                Another way is to start to see yourself in other people. To get that there is no real separation between you and other people.
                That may sound vague. So one practical suggestion and thought you may want to try for a day is that everyone you meet is your 
                friend.Another thing you can try is to see what parts of yourself you can see in someone you meet. Try it out and see what you 
                find.

                <h4>2. Your relationships are in your mind.</h4>

                How you choose to interpret people and your relationships makes a huge difference. So much of our relationships may be perceived 
                to happen out there somewhere.<br><br>

                But as mentioned in tip #1 in this article, your underlying frame of mind – do you build bridges or walls? – will determine much 
                about your interactions both new people and people you know.<br><br>

                So you really have to go inside. You have to realize that your interpretations from the past are interpretations. Not reality. 
                You have to take a look at your assumptions and expectations and thought habits. Find patterns that may be hurting you (and others). 
                This isn’t easy. Or always pleasant. You may discover that you have had some negative underlying habits of thought for many years.<br><br>

                But to change you have to do it. Instead of just keep looking at yourself as some sort of unmoving and objective observer of the 
                world and reality. A change in you could – over time – change your whole world.

                <h4>3. Avoid being boring.</h4>

                Don’t prattle on about your new car for 10 minutes oblivious to your surroundings. Always be prepared to drop a subject when you 
                start to bore people. Or when everyone is getting bored and the topic is starting to run out of steam.<br><br>

                One good way to have something interesting to say is simply to lead an interesting life. And to focus on the positive stuff. Don’t 
                start to whine about your boss or your job, people don’t want to hear that. Instead, talk about your last trip somewhere, some funny 
                anecdote that happened while you were buying clothes, your plans for the summer or something fun or exciting.

                <h4>4. Focus outward, not inward.</h4>

                A lot of people use the second, far less effective way. It is appealing because it’s about instant gratification and about ME, ME, 
                ME! The first way – to become interested in people – perhaps works better because it makes you a pleasant exception and because the 
                law of reciprocity is strong in people. As you treat people, they will treat you. Be interested in them and they will be interested 
                in you.

                <h4>5. Don’t get stuck in the questions.</h4>

                If you ask too many questions the conversation can feel like a bit of an interrogation. Or like you don’t have that much too contribute. 
                One alternative is to mix questions with statements. Just say what band you are really into instead of asking what band they are into. 
                Or say what you think about local sports team’s chances of winning the next game. Or, while using common sense, just what you are thinking 
                about what is happening around you right now. And then the conversation can flow on from there.<br><br>

                So open up and say what you think, share how you feel. And if someone shares an experience, open up too and share one of your experiences. 
                Don’t just stand there nodding and answer with short sentences. If someone is investing in the conversation they’d like you to invest too.<br><br>

                And like in so many areas in life, you can’t always wait for the other party to make the first move. When needed, be proactive and be the 
                first one to open up and invest in the conversation.

                <h4>6. Genuineness is awesome.</h4>

                I think that one of the most important things in a relationship of any kind is to be genuine. Few things are as powerful as genuine 
                communication and letting the genuine you shine through. Without incongruence, mixed messages or perhaps a sort of phoniness. It’s 
                you to 100%.<br><br>

                It’s you with not only your words but you with your voice tonality and body language – which some say is over 90% of communication – on the 
                same wavelength as your words. It’s you coming through on all channels of communication.<br><br>

                Being your geunine self – the one where you build bridges and are open and giving – will give you better results and more satisfaction in your 
                day to day life because you are in alignment with yourself. And because people really like genuineness.

                <h1>The Importance of Being Social</h1>
                One advantage of belonging to a cohesive society in which people help each other is that the group is often better equipped than a set 
                of individuals to deal with threats from the outside. People intuitively realize there is strength in numbers, and take comfort in the 
                company of others, especially in times of anxiety or need. Or, as Patrick Henry famously said, “United we stand, divided we fall.”<br><br>
                
                It’s all good and well that we can unite against an external foe, but what is perhaps more interesting is a result put forth by 
                a slew of recent studies: people who are a part of a group are also far better equipped to conquer an internal foe—the threat of 
                ad health.<br><br>

                To appreciate the impact of social connection on the state of your body, one need only consider what happens when it is 
                abruptly cut off. Many languages have expressions such as “hurt feelings” that compare the pain of such social rejection 
                to the pain of physical injury. We now know that those are more than just metaphors: there are two components to physical 
                pain, an unpleasant emotional feeling, and a feeling of sensory distress, associated with different structures in the brain. 
                Social pain is also associated with a particular brain structure, the anterior cingulate cortex—the same structure involved 
                in the emotional component of physical pain. This connection between physical and social pain reflects the tie between social 
                connection and the physiological processes of the body. <br><br>

                In one of the recent studies on the health benefits of social relationships, published earlier this year, researchers provided 
                evidence that social ties and increased contact with family and friends are associated with a lower risk of death in young 
                women with breast cancer. Another presented a similar conclusion with respect to surviving heart surgery. What’s more, a 2010 
                meta-analysis of 148 other studies showed that social connection doesn’t just help us survive health problems: the lack of it 
                causes them.<br><br>

                In a study whose results are typical of the 148 reviewed, researchers surveyed 4775 adults in Alameda County, near San Francisco. 
                The subjects completed a survey asking about social ties such as marriage, contacts with extended family and friends, and group 
                affiliation. Each individual’s answers were translated into a number on a “social network index,” with a high number meaning the 
                person had many regular and close social contacts, and a low number representing relative social isolation. The researchers then 
                tracked the health of their subjects over the next nine years.<br><br>

                Since the participants had varying backgrounds, the scientists employed mathematical techniques to isolate the effects of social 
                connectivity from risk factors such as smoking and also from socioeconomic status and reported levels of life satisfaction. They 
                found a striking result. Over the nine-year period, those who placed low on the social network index were twice as likely to die 
                as individuals who had placed high on the index but had otherwise similar risk factors.<br><br>

                In the course of researching this issue for my new book, Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior, just released 
                today, I took a look at a web directory of support groups in Los Angeles. I found groups focused on abusive behavior, acne, adderall 
                addiction, addiction, ADHD, adoption, agoraphobia, alcoholism, albinism, Alzheimer’s disease, ambien use, anemia, anger management, 
                anorexia, anxiety, arthritis, Asperger’s syndrome, asthma, ativan addiction and autism—and that’s just the A’s. This abundance of 
                support groups is a reflection of the human desire to associate with others, especially in time of need. The research shows that 
                it’s a beneficial instinct.<br><br>

                Of course, we’re not all alike. We all know people who need people—and those who appear to need them much less. Does social contact 
                matter more to some people than to others? Genetics suggests it does. Recent research hints that the biochemical carrier of the 
                benefits of social support is the neuropeptide oxytocin. It is well known that oxytocin plays an essential role in the regulation 
                of social behavior and attachment, and has throughout mammalian evolution. When administered to volunteers, for example, oxytocin 
                reduces stress responses and increases prosocial behavior. Your genes enter the picture because studies suggest that the gene for 
                the oxytocin receptors in the brain comes in a “more social” and “less social” form. People having the latter form of the gene tend 
                to be less empathetic and demonstrate more negative affect. A paper published last December indicates that the more social form of 
                this gene, called OXTR, is required for a person to benefit from social support. For individuals with this version of the gene, 
                social connection lowered stress levels, but enlisting a friend’s counsel did not calm those who lacked this form of the gene.<br><br>

                Until genetic testing becomes commonplace, most of us will just have to go with our instincts regarding the importance of having a 
                social network. And until then, hermits will remain bad bets for life insurance underwriters.<br><br>
