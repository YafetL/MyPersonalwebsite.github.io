        Nick Hendricks and Dale Arbus are friends who despise their bosses. Nick works at Comnidyne, a financial firm for the sadistic 
        David Harken, who hints at a possible promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant 
        being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris; she threatens to tell his fiancée Stacy that he had sex with her unless 
        he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman enjoys working for Jack Pellit at a chemical company,
        but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby, whose apathy 
        and incompetence threaten the future of the company.<br><br>

        At night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around. Initially 
        hesitant, they eventually agree to kill their employers. In search of a hitman, the trio meet Dean "Muthafuckah" Jones, an ex-con 
        who agrees to be their "murder consultant." Jones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other's bosses to hide their motive 
        while making the deaths look like accidents.<br><br>

        The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals his phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while 
        Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter 
        on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with 
        Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex 
        with him. Nick and Dale wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone 
        in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, while 
        Nick secretly witnesses the murder.<br><br>

        Nick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. 
        They are questioned by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police 
        are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been 
        imprisoned for bootlegging a film. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash 
        Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio 
        recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but 
        Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely 
        disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to 
        frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness.<br><br>

        The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator, Gregory, reveals that it is his company's policy to record all 
        conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing he murdered Bobby. Harken is sentenced to 25 years 
        to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company but under a sadistic CEO, Kurt 
        retains his job but also under a new boss, and Dale, with the help of Jones, blackmails Julia into ending her harassment.<br><br>
