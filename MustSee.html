        <td><h1>The best online programming courses and tutorials from one click away</h1>
            <big>Before I start talking about the course I want to say something about online learning.
                People often misjudge online course without even knowing or trying one.
                If you have taken face-to-face classes all your life, being a little 
                apprehensive at the beginning is normal. However, taking an online course, 
                as opposed to a face-to-face class, definitely has its perks. Here are 
                five advantages to studying online.
                
                <h4>1. Career advancement and hobbies</h4>
                    Studying online gives you more flexibility. You can work and fit your work schedule (and your hobbies) 
                    around your coursework more easily; even more so if you are taking an asynchronous class: an online class 
                    where you don’t have to log in at a specific time for a live session but you can study and interact with 
                    your instructor and your fellow classmates at your own pace through, for example, the discussion forum.<br><br>

                    In a survey conducted by The Learning House, 44% of online students reported improvements in their 
                    employment standing, for example by obtaining a full-time job within 12 months of graduation, 
                    and 45% reported a salary increase.<br><br>

                    By the time you finish your online course, you will have gained more work experience and learned new skills 
                    that will help you advance in your career!

                <h4>2. Flexible schedule and environment</h4>
                    By studying online, you choose your own learning environment that works best for your needs: be it your 
                    bedroom, your study, the café across the street, or your local gym, listening to your instructor’s lecture 
                    podcast as you run on the treadmill. Isn’t that awesome?<br><br>

                    Taking an online course also means that you don’t have to commute to class, which means less time spent on 
                    the bus and more study time sitting on your couch, the sound of a crackling fireplace in the background. 
                    You no longer have to worry about driving in the snowstorm and missing an important class

                <h4>3. Lower costs and debts</h4>
                    Studying online means that you pay the tuition fee, possibly book supplies, an online application fee, and 
                    few other items. You don’t, however, incur the costs of housing (which can range from $10,000 to $12,000 per 
                    year) and transportation, which translates to lower debts and more savings.

                <h4>4. Self-discipline and responsibility</h4>
                    Who says that having to be more self-disciplined is a disadvantage? It is true that studying online requires 
                    more self-motivation and time-management skills, because you will spend a lot of time on your own without 
                    someone physically close to keep you focused on deadlines. Look at it this way: your online course will not 
                    only teach you geology or poetry, it will also help you become more self-motivated, a trait that will make 
                    you stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will look great on your résumé.

                <h4>5. More choice of course topics</h4>
                    Let’s face it, when thinking about what to study, besides for interest and career opportunities, where to 
                    study is also a deciding factor. This may limit the choice of subjects or courses to take. Studying online at 
                    your own convenience allows you to no longer worry about class location when choosing what to learn next. By 
                    taking an online course, you can really focus on the subject you are interested in and choose from the variety 
                    of online courses and programs.</big><td></td>
