                <h1>How to Use Your Body to Calm Your Brain</h1>
                You know that your brain controls your body, but did you know that your body also controls your brain? It’s a feedback loop that 
                works both ways. The activity in your brain changes every second based on what your body is doing. This process is called 
                biofeedback.<br><br>

                You may have thought that biofeedback required equipment, like a finger heart rate monitor or software. While technology can 
                make measuring bodily changes easier, it’s not necessary. You can alter your brain’s function with conscious biofeedback simply 
                by paying attention. For example, slowing your breathing or relaxing specific muscles can directly impact your thoughts, feelings, 
                emotions, and stress levels.<br><br>

                Your brain is perfectly equipped to notice what’s going on with your body — heart rate, breathing, muscle tension, sweating. 
                In fact, it’s doing it all the time anyway. You just have to notice it. To practice conscious biofeedback, you have to become 
                aware and guide the process.<br><br>

                Now a days, we have equipments and a neurofeedback therapy to calming the mind.However, you don’t need any equipment to successfully 
                use your body to calm your brain or to stimulate your vagus nerve. You just have to become aware of and influence your body through 
                your own actions. Some ways to do this are:

                <h4>Splash cold water on your face</h4>
                Rinsing your face with cold water stimulates your vagus nerve. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stressed or anxious try filling 
                a sink with cool water and splashing your face. If you’re up for it, a cold shower or anything that exposes your body to cold 
                also does the trick.

                <h4>Use the power of music</h4>
                Music has been shown to increase or decrease HRV. While just listening to music works, making music has an even greater positive 
                effect.  Music engages most of your brain and limbic system, which largely governs emotions.

                <h4>Smile</h4>
                It’s a simple thing to do and really can improve your mood. Even a fake smile causes your brain to release dopamine. Think of a 
                fun time, a silly situation or your favorite joke. In your brain, there’s not much difference between forced and spontaneous 
                smiling.

                <h4></h4>Stand up straight</h4>
                Studies have shown that standing up straight in a more confident posture makes you feel more decisive and confident in your own 
                thoughts and beliefs, and confident postures also correlated with being more optimistic. Posture is an important source of feedback 
                for your brain. One study even showed that standing up straighter increases strength. Sitting straighter has similar effects.

                <h4>Calm your face</h4>
                There’s a muscle in the middle of your forehead in between your eyebrows, called the corrugator supercilii. It pulls your 
                eyebrows down and together, causing your forehead to wrinkle. In the same way your brain thinks you’re happy when you smile, 
                if your brow is furrowed and this muscle is tense, your brain interprets it as you being worried or upset. On bright days, 
                wearing sunglasses will reduce squinting and relax this muscle making your brain feel calmer.

                <h4>Relax your jaw and tongue</h4> 
                When you’re stressed, you tend to clench your teeth and tense your tongue. However, when you consciously loosen your jaw, your 
                brain relaxes too. You can wiggle it around and open your mouth wide. Make it a point to relax your tongue which also calms 
                your mind.

                <h4>Change your breathing</h4>
                Relaxed breathing slows your heart rate and activates the calm, parasympathetic nervous system. There are many breathing 
                techniques that calm your brain and body instantly. Conversely, breathe faster, and you will create more energy.

                <h4>Clench and relax</h4>
                Sometimes it’s actually helpful to clench your muscles and relax them to fully know the difference. Take a deep breath and 
                intentionally flex a tense muscle for a few seconds. After holding it, exhale and relax the muscle. The most important muscles 
                to relax are in your face. However,  don’t forget your hands, neck, shoulders, butt, back, and stomach. We do this in yoga. 
                It works!

                <h1>How Music Helps Your Mental Health</h1>
                There are very few things that stimulate the brain in the way it does. It’s one of the most demanding cognitive and neural 
                challenging activities. Music requires complex and accurate timing of multiple actions in your brain because of the structural, 
                mathematical, and architectural relationships between the notes. Although it may not feel like it, your brain is doing a lot of 
                computing to make sense of all the incoming stimuli. It’s one of the few activities that activate almost every part of your brain.<br><br>

                The effects of music are cognitive, psychological, social, behavioral, and emotional.<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/keep-your-brain-young-with-music" target="blanck">Research</a>  has shown that listening to musical 
                pieces can reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and pain as well as improve sleep quality, mood, mental alertness, and memory. Active 
                engagement with music has lasting brain benefits, such as improving concentration, memory, self-discipline, and confidence.  The 
                cognitive benefits of music education extend from early childhood to old age. Some studies show that it can make you smarter. It 
                may even help ward off the effects of brain aging.

                <h2>Music’s Mental Health Benefits</h2>
                <h4>Reduces Stress</h4>
                Research shows that listening to certain melodies can lower the stress hormone, cortisol. In one study reviewed, patients 
                about to undergo surgery who listened to music had less anxiety and lower cortisol levels than people who had taken drugs.<br><br>

                Listening to music triggers the brain’s nucleus accumbens, responsible for releasing the feel-good neurochemical dopamine, 
                which is an integral part of the pleasure-reward and motivational systems and plays a critical role in learning. Higher 
                dopamine levels improve concentration, boost mood, and enhance memory. Dopamine is the chemical responsible for the yummy 
                feelings you get from eating chocolate, having an orgasm, or a runner’s high.

                <h4>Decreases Depression</h4>
                Science shows that music can help alleviate depression and help a person feel more hopeful and in control of their life. 
                There is even evidence that listening to music can aid in rewiring trauma in the brain. Creating harmonies with others or 
                enjoying live music, like at a concert, gets the brain hormone oxytocin flowing increasing feelings of connectedness, trust, 
                and social bonding.<br><br>

                A study appearing in the World Journal of Psychiatry found that musical therapy successfully reduced depression and anxiety 
                in patients suffering from neurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease. Researchers also noted 
                that the therapy had no negative side effects and was a safe, low-risk treatment tool. Other research showed that musical 
                therapy significantly improved depressive symptoms.

                <h2>How Music Helps Your Mental Health</h2>
                <h4>Boosts Mood</h4>
                One study found that people who listened to upbeat tunes could improve their mood and boost happiness levels in just two weeks. 
                In the experiment, one group was instructed to try to improve their mood with music. The other participants were told to listen 
                to music but were not guided to try to intentionally elevate their mood. When participants were later asked to describe their 
                happiness levels, those who had purposefully tried to improve their moods reported feeling happier after just two weeks.<br><br>

                Not surprisingly, another study found that different types of music had different effects on mood. Researchers determined that 
                classical and meditation scores offered the greatest mood-boosting benefits. Heavy metal and techno were found to be ineffective 
                and in some cases, detrimental. Surprisingly though, even sad music can bring most listeners pleasure and comfort, according to 
                one study.<br><br>

                While listening to music can bring multiple mental and physical health benefits, creating it can be therapy, too. Singing in a 
                choir has many mood-boosting and mental health benefits. Of course, playing a musical instrument has advantages for both your 
                mental wellbeing and physical brain health.

                <h4>Increases Motivation and Enhances </h4>
                There’s a good reason why exercise classes blast the beats or runners have tunes playing in their earbuds. Research shows that 
                listening to fast-paced music motivates people to work out harder.<br><br>

                In one experiment, 12 healthy male students pedaled stationary bikes. The participants rode for 25 minutes in three sessions and 
                listened to six songs. Unbeknownst to the bikers, the researchers were altering the tempos and measuring performances. For example, 
                the songs were played at a normal speed, increased by ten percent, or slowed by ten percent.<br><br>

                The researchers discovered that speeding up the tracks resulted in increased performance in terms of distance covered, the speed 
                of pedaling, and power exerted. Interestingly, listening to faster-paced songs not only caused exercisers to work harder during 
                their workouts; they also reported enjoying the music more. Conversely, slowing down the tempo led to decreases in all of the 
                variables.

                <h4>Strengthens Social Bonds</h4>
                In a 2013 review of the research on music, Stefan Koelsch, a music psychologist at the Freie University Berlin, determined the 
                mechanisms through which music allows us to connect with one another. It impacts brain circuits involved in empathy, trust, and 
                cooperation. This might explain how it has survived in every culture of the world. Music is one of the few activities where people 
                around the globe respond in a common way. It connects all kinds of people across a myriad of cultures, traditions, and practices all 
                over the world.
                <h1>The Importance of Being Social</h1>
                One advantage of belonging to a cohesive society in which people help each other is that the group is often better equipped than a set 
                of individuals to deal with threats from the outside. People intuitively realize there is strength in numbers, and take comfort in the 
                company of others, especially in times of anxiety or need. Or, as Patrick Henry famously said, “United we stand, divided we fall.”<br><br>
                
                It’s all good and well that we can unite against an external foe, but what is perhaps more interesting is a result put forth by 
                a slew of recent studies: people who are a part of a group are also far better equipped to conquer an internal foe—the threat of 
                ad health.<br><br>

                To appreciate the impact of social connection on the state of your body, one need only consider what happens when it is 
                abruptly cut off. Many languages have expressions such as “hurt feelings” that compare the pain of such social rejection 
                to the pain of physical injury. We now know that those are more than just metaphors: there are two components to physical 
                pain, an unpleasant emotional feeling, and a feeling of sensory distress, associated with different structures in the brain. 
                Social pain is also associated with a particular brain structure, the anterior cingulate cortex—the same structure involved 
                in the emotional component of physical pain. This connection between physical and social pain reflects the tie between social 
                connection and the physiological processes of the body. <br><br>

                In one of the recent studies on the health benefits of social relationships, published earlier this year, researchers provided 
                evidence that social ties and increased contact with family and friends are associated with a lower risk of death in young 
                women with breast cancer. Another presented a similar conclusion with respect to surviving heart surgery. What’s more, a 2010 
                meta-analysis of 148 other studies showed that social connection doesn’t just help us survive health problems: the lack of it 
                causes them.<br><br>

                In a study whose results are typical of the 148 reviewed, researchers surveyed 4775 adults in Alameda County, near San Francisco. 
                The subjects completed a survey asking about social ties such as marriage, contacts with extended family and friends, and group 
                affiliation. Each individual’s answers were translated into a number on a “social network index,” with a high number meaning the 
                person had many regular and close social contacts, and a low number representing relative social isolation. The researchers then 
                tracked the health of their subjects over the next nine years.<br><br>

                Since the participants had varying backgrounds, the scientists employed mathematical techniques to isolate the effects of social 
                connectivity from risk factors such as smoking and also from socioeconomic status and reported levels of life satisfaction. They 
                found a striking result. Over the nine-year period, those who placed low on the social network index were twice as likely to die 
                as individuals who had placed high on the index but had otherwise similar risk factors.<br><br>

                In the course of researching this issue for my new book, Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior, just released 
                today, I took a look at a web directory of support groups in Los Angeles. I found groups focused on abusive behavior, acne, adderall 
                addiction, addiction, ADHD, adoption, agoraphobia, alcoholism, albinism, Alzheimer’s disease, ambien use, anemia, anger management, 
                anorexia, anxiety, arthritis, Asperger’s syndrome, asthma, ativan addiction and autism—and that’s just the A’s. This abundance of 
                support groups is a reflection of the human desire to associate with others, especially in time of need. The research shows that 
                it’s a beneficial instinct.<br><br>

                Of course, we’re not all alike. We all know people who need people—and those who appear to need them much less. Does social contact 
                matter more to some people than to others? Genetics suggests it does. Recent research hints that the biochemical carrier of the 
                benefits of social support is the neuropeptide oxytocin. It is well known that oxytocin plays an essential role in the regulation 
                of social behavior and attachment, and has throughout mammalian evolution. When administered to volunteers, for example, oxytocin 
                reduces stress responses and increases prosocial behavior. Your genes enter the picture because studies suggest that the gene for 
                the oxytocin receptors in the brain comes in a “more social” and “less social” form. People having the latter form of the gene tend 
                to be less empathetic and demonstrate more negative affect. A paper published last December indicates that the more social form of 
                this gene, called OXTR, is required for a person to benefit from social support. For individuals with this version of the gene, 
                social connection lowered stress levels, but enlisting a friend’s counsel did not calm those who lacked this form of the gene.<br><br>

                Until genetic testing becomes commonplace, most of us will just have to go with our instincts regarding the importance of having a 
                social network. And until then, hermits will remain bad bets for life insurance underwriters.
                <h1>How to Improve Your Social Life</h1>
                <h2>6 of My Favorite Timeless Tips</h2>
                <h4>1. Be wary of building walls</h4>

                The ego wants to divide your world. It wants to create barriers, separation and loves to play the comparison game. The game where 
                people are different compared to you, the game where you are better than someone and worse than someone else. All of that creates 
                fear. And so we build walls. But putting up walls tends to in the end hurt you more than protect you.<br><br>

                So how can you start building bridges instead? One way is to choose to be curious about people. Curiosity is filled with 
                anticipation and enthusiasm. It opens you up. And when you are open and enthusiastic then you have more fun things to think 
                about than focusing on your fear.<br><br>

                Another way is to start to see yourself in other people. To get that there is no real separation between you and other people.
                That may sound vague. So one practical suggestion and thought you may want to try for a day is that everyone you meet is your 
                friend.Another thing you can try is to see what parts of yourself you can see in someone you meet. Try it out and see what you 
                find.

                <h4>2. Your relationships are in your mind.</h4>

                How you choose to interpret people and your relationships makes a huge difference. So much of our relationships may be perceived 
                to happen out there somewhere.<br><br>

                But as mentioned in tip #1 in this article, your underlying frame of mind – do you build bridges or walls? – will determine much 
                about your interactions both new people and people you know.<br><br>

                So you really have to go inside. You have to realize that your interpretations from the past are interpretations. Not reality. 
                You have to take a look at your assumptions and expectations and thought habits. Find patterns that may be hurting you (and others). 
                This isn’t easy. Or always pleasant. You may discover that you have had some negative underlying habits of thought for many years.<br><br>

                But to change you have to do it. Instead of just keep looking at yourself as some sort of unmoving and objective observer of the 
                world and reality. A change in you could – over time – change your whole world.

                <h4>3. Avoid being boring.</h4>

                Don’t prattle on about your new car for 10 minutes oblivious to your surroundings. Always be prepared to drop a subject when you 
                start to bore people. Or when everyone is getting bored and the topic is starting to run out of steam.<br><br>

                One good way to have something interesting to say is simply to lead an interesting life. And to focus on the positive stuff. Don’t 
                start to whine about your boss or your job, people don’t want to hear that. Instead, talk about your last trip somewhere, some funny 
                anecdote that happened while you were buying clothes, your plans for the summer or something fun or exciting.

                <h4>4. Focus outward, not inward.</h4>

                A lot of people use the second, far less effective way. It is appealing because it’s about instant gratification and about ME, ME, 
                ME! The first way – to become interested in people – perhaps works better because it makes you a pleasant exception and because the 
                law of reciprocity is strong in people. As you treat people, they will treat you. Be interested in them and they will be interested 
                in you.

                <h4>5. Don’t get stuck in the questions.</h4>

                If you ask too many questions the conversation can feel like a bit of an interrogation. Or like you don’t have that much too contribute. 
                One alternative is to mix questions with statements. Just say what band you are really into instead of asking what band they are into. 
                Or say what you think about local sports team’s chances of winning the next game. Or, while using common sense, just what you are thinking 
                about what is happening around you right now. And then the conversation can flow on from there.<br><br>

                So open up and say what you think, share how you feel. And if someone shares an experience, open up too and share one of your experiences. 
                Don’t just stand there nodding and answer with short sentences. If someone is investing in the conversation they’d like you to invest too.<br><br>

                And like in so many areas in life, you can’t always wait for the other party to make the first move. When needed, be proactive and be the 
                first one to open up and invest in the conversation.

                <h4>6. Genuineness is awesome.</h4>

                I think that one of the most important things in a relationship of any kind is to be genuine. Few things are as powerful as genuine 
                communication and letting the genuine you shine through. Without incongruence, mixed messages or perhaps a sort of phoniness. It’s 
                you to 100%.<br><br>

                It’s you with not only your words but you with your voice tonality and body language – which some say is over 90% of communication – on the 
                same wavelength as your words. It’s you coming through on all channels of communication.<br><br>

                Being your geunine self – the one where you build bridges and are open and giving – will give you better results and more satisfaction in your 
                day to day life because you are in alignment with yourself. And because people really like genuineness.

                <h1>Manager vs Leader. Who are You?</h1>

                Did you know that actually there are lots of differences between a manager and a leader? These differences are quite crucial 
                and predefine the group of people you belong to. If you are not sure what type of a person you are or want to be, this 
                article might help you.<br><br>

                At the first sight, it may seem that all managers should be leaders or that all leaders should always be in top management 
                positions or somewhat similar. However, this is not always true. Sometimes, the head of an organization, CEO or even a president 
                is not a leader. Does this sound confusing? Let’s go ahead and dive into this stuff deeper.<br><br>

                A manager is someone who plans, delegates and controls the usage and coordination of team resources and project activities in 
                order to achieve certain goals in conjunction with five functions of management: planning, organizing, staffing, leading and 
                controlling. Managers always push people to set and achieve goals.<br><br>

                A leader is someone with his own vision and interpersonal skills. Leaders always guide, influence and coach people. They follow 
                the direction of a team in order to set and achieve goals. Leadership is more like influencing, inspiring and motivating employees 
                to set and achieve goals and to be a part of a certain process.<br><br>

                We may say that managers are mostly focused on things, they push and direct. Whereas leaders focus on people and their development, 
                they pull and influence. So when answering the main question of this article I can say that every person can be either a leader or 
                a manager as well as both at the same time, but that takes a totally different set of skills.<br><br>

                In my humble opinion, today’s world is full of managers, while leaders are truly hard to find as it takes a person to possess a whole 
                set of interpersonal skills like the ability to motivate, to influence, to inspire, and pull people forward. Not all managers can be 
                leaders as well as not all leaders can be managers. Some leaders may strongly dislike administrative work and see it as super boring 
                and routine. So, where do we find leaders?<br><br>

                Leaders can be found at any part of the organization. Not all of them are working at top positions, as managers can brilliantly lead 
                companies without being leaders. Other organizations are governed by leaders who have a great team of managers doing all the 
                administrative work and carrying out the management functions.<br><br>

                Here is a comparative list showcasing major similarities and differences between leaders and managers:<br><br>
                <strong> A manager:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>is a part of the formal process;</li>
                    <li>is involved in a process;</li>
                    <li>pushes people who need to be a part of the organization;</li>
                    <li>solves problems and drives change;</li>
                    <li>pushes people.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong> A leader:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>is not a part of the formal organization;</li>
                    <li>leads by influence with or without power;</li>
                    <li>has a group of people who want to follow him;</li>
                    <li>leads change and influences people;</li>
                    <li>motivates and creates momentum.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong> Major commonalities between leaders and managers are as follows:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>both have a vision;</li>
                    <li>are responsible for setting and achieving goals;</li>
                    <li>are responsible for achieving results;</li>
                    <li>are responsible for continuous improvement of the process they are involved in;</li>
                    <li>have followers they need to listen to.</li>
                </ul>
                To sum it up, I can say that organizations need both leaders and managers to perform successfully and assure continuous process of 
                development and innovation. Combining both managerial and leading skills can be quite challenging but it is never too late to try 
                to learn something new and become a better person with new valuable skills and abilities.

                <h1>Why is leadership important for managers?</h1>

                Leadership is perhaps the most important function of management - it helps to maximise efficiency which can help to achieve the overall 
                vision and goals of the business. Here are some points that justify why leadership is so important in regard to management.

                <h4>Initiates action</h4>
                A leader is someone who initiates work. It begins with them clearly communicating their plans and policies to their staff. Without the 
                initiation of the work, no goals can be achieved.

                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                In order for the work to be completed on time and to a high standard, motivation is required, and that comes from leadership. By 
                effectively motivating the employees with both economic as well as non-economic rewards, the work will be carried out by happy and 
                incentivised employees.

                <h4>Guidance</h4>
                Sometimes employees will need a helping hand. This is where a manager can demonstrate their skills by providing helpful guidance, which 
                will show employees the way they need to perform the work both efficiently and effectively.

                <h4>Confidence</h4>
                Confidence is often overlooked but it can be vital when it comes to a business achieving its goals. Good leaders are able to explain 
                their employees' roles to them, giving them clear parameters and guidelines, which they can work within to achieve their goals. An 
                employee who is clear on their position and role will be able to develop confidence and work effectively towards completing all of 
                their tasks.
                
                <h4>Building morale</h4>
                Good morale, which once again comes from leadership, will lead to willing co-operation from the employees towards their tasks. It will 
                also help you to win their trust. A manager who is able to boost morale will be well positioned to achieve full co-operation from staff.

                <h4>Work environment</h4>
                Management is all about getting things done. An efficient and pleasant work environment will help encourage growth. Achieving a good 
                working environment comes from a leader who is able to treat their employees like humans. Reconciling personal interests of the employees 
                with the organisation's goals is an effective way to deliver long-term achievements whilst allowing your employees to grow within their 
                role.

                <h3>Leadership skills for managers</h3>
                Now that we've established what leadership is and why it's so important to management, let's take a look at some of the leadership skills 
                for managers that are required in order to get the most out of your staff and set your business on its way towards achieving its goals and 
                reaching its vision.

                <h4>Honesty and integrity</h4>
                When it comes to leadership, honesty is about being transparent and open. You need to be willing to communicate your thoughts and feelings, 
                even if what you're saying is unpopular or uncomfortable. It also means keeping your word as well as following through on any promises you 
                make.<br><br>

                Integrity, on the other hand, goes hand in hand with work ethic and having a good work ethic sets an example. If you always make the effort 
                to make the best possible decisions both in the interest of your company and your staff, employees will look at you as a leader with 
                integrity.

                <h4>Problem solving</h4>
                A lot of people believe that problem solving is fixing an error irrespective of the cost. In actual fact, many leaders will tell you that a 
                problem could end up being an opportunity, and effective problem solving is about embracing that fact. It's also about avoiding finger-pointing 
                at all costs; if a problem emerges, it's vital that you don't get caught up trying to blame someone. It's unproductive, wastes time and doesn't 
                solve the issue.<br><br>

                Instead, it's important to look at things in an analytical way. Collecting data is always an effective method when it comes to getting through 
                problems. It avoids having to rely on guesswork and will help you to ensure the problem doesn't happen again. Above all else, it's important 
                that a manager stays positive during a problem. Reacting negatively will impact morale and create panic.

                <h4>Delegate work to team members' strengths</h4>
                Recognising your team members' strengths will help create a positive workplace environment and ensure tasks get completed in a timely manner. 
                If possible, carry out either a formal or informal strengths assessment. You can assess the strengths of a team member through observation or 
                even through an interview. Alternatively, you can use a more formal method such as a strength-based questionnaire.

                <h4>Communicate powerfully and prolifically</h4>
                Perhaps the most important aspect of being a leader is communication. You can be incredibly innovative and technically gifted but if you lack 
                the skills in order to effectively communicate your ideas and methods, they will struggle to get off the ground.

                Essentially, powerful communication will help you to influence as well as inspire your team. In order to do that, there are three tools you will
                need to master:
                <ul>
                    <li>Active listening</li>
                    <li>Creative questioning</li>
                    <li>Responding influentially</li>
                </ul>

                Active listening will give you a greater understanding and awareness of any given situation, and the same can be said for creative questioning. 
                Responding in an influential way will help you to convey effective words and messages which will inspire your team.<br><br>

                It can take time, and linking listening, questioning and messaging requires delicate and careful skills. Once you get it right, however, your 
                conversations will be infinitely more constructive and will lead to more successful meetings.

                <h4>Collaborate and promote teamwork</h4>
                Promoting teamwork wherever possible will help your team work more cohesively towards the company's vision. A good way to achieve teamwork is 
                through meetings and assigning tasks that require your team to communicate with each other as well as form trust and be able to support each other.<br><br>

                Once the task has been completed, team members will have added respect for each other and value other members' roles. It may also work if you 
                provide incentives or rewards for fulfilling the tasks as this could help to motivate them even more.

                <h4>Drive for results</h4>
                A leader is always looking to drive results, but this shouldn't come at the cost of employee engagement. One method effective managers employ for 
                driving results is by giving their employees accountability. When you make your people accountable for their own work, results and decisions, the 
                effectiveness of an organisation will generally increase greatly.<br><br>

                In order to drive results, it's also vital that all decisions are well thought out. By simply aligning your decisions with your values and by 
                including your team in the decision-making process, you can transform results into a set of goals which is shared.<br><br>
