        <h1>How Does My Brain Work?</h1>
        The thing I'm going to write now is How I Study More Effectively.
        Students who start out strong at the beginning of the semester may 
        quickly start to feel overwhelmed if they haven’t developed good 
        study habits.<br><br>
        Any course load can be conquered and any material can be mastered if you know 
        how to study well and effectively.<br><br>
        Check out these tips to ace your courses:
        <h3>Take Good Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The most important thing you need to do in order to be able to have productive 
                study sessions is to take good class notes. Some basic tips include:</li>
            <li>Write down everything on the board. If the teacher took the time to write 
                it down, you can bet it’s important.</li>
            <li>Make particular note of the names of people, events, places and dates.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to gestures and tone of voice. Most teachers will slow down 
                when they’re making an important point. They may raise a hand to get the student’s 
                attention or actually say, “This is important” or “This is a key point”. 
                Write down whatever they say next.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pay Attention to Study Advice from teachers</h3>
        Some teachers will give you a study guide for their course in the beginning of 
        the semester with specific tips and advice on how to do well in their course. 
        Take full advantage of this and follow their advice as closely as possible. 
        After all, if they’re telling you how to ace their course, why wouldn’t you 
        follow their instructions? Don’t be afraid to approach your teachers with 
        any questions or concerns you have about any of the material. Making sure you 
        have the right information is key to doing well.
        <h3>Review Your Notes Soon After Class</h3>
        Few students practice this technique but all should. Half an hour or so after 
        class ends, open your notebook and go over that day’s notes. This short time lapse 
        between class and reviewing helps you to retain information much more effectively 
        than if you did it even as soon as later that night.
        <h3>Review All Your Notes Regularly</h3>
        Besides reviewing your notes after class, you should also periodically review all your 
        notes, going over the cumulative notes from the entire course from beginning to end. 
        This method helps you keep the information continually refreshed so you don’t forget 
        important details from earlier in the course.
        <h3>Read Your Notes Out Loud</h3>
        Some students have an easier time remembering things if they hear it rather than read it. 
        If that’s the case, you can read your notes out loud to yourself to reinforce them. You 
        could also record yourself reading your notes and play them to yourself while you’re cleaning 
        your room or going for a walk to help the information sink in more.
        <h3>Join a Study Group</h3>
        Having the support of other students can really help motivate you to study. A study group has 
        the benefit of having the perspectives of other students as well. It can help you sharpen your 
        analysis of the class material as well as enhance your ability to defend a certain position 
        which you may be asked to do in essays or on exams.
        <h3>Don’t Binge Study</h3>
        If there’s one study habit you should avoid, it’s this one. This type of studying, where you review 
        large amounts of material all at once is totally ineffective. It exhausts the brain and can often 
        lead to confusion when it comes to test time. The small percentage of information that you do retain 
        will also only be stored in your brain for a fleeting amount of time. Consistent methodical studying 
        and review of the materials over the course of the semester is a much more effective way to retain 
        information.<br><br>
        These study tips got me through all my courses and I hope it will get you through any course and allow 
        you to take exams with confidence.<br><br>
