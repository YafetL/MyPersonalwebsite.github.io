      <h1>How to Improve Your Social Life</h1>
      <img src="./asset/image/meeting.jpg"><br><br>
      <h2>6 of My Favorite Timeless Tips</h2>
      <h4>1. Be wary of building walls</h4>

      The ego wants to divide your world. It wants to create barriers, separation and loves to play the comparison game. The game where 
      people are different compared to you, the game where you are better than someone and worse than someone else. All of that creates 
      fear. And so we build walls. But putting up walls tends to in the end hurt you more than protect you.<br><br>

      So how can you start building bridges instead? One way is to choose to be curious about people. Curiosity is filled with 
      anticipation and enthusiasm. It opens you up. And when you are open and enthusiastic then you have more fun things to think 
      about than focusing on your fear.<br><br>

      Another way is to start to see yourself in other people. To get that there is no real separation between you and other people.
      That may sound vague. So one practical suggestion and thought you may want to try for a day is that everyone you meet is your 
      friend.Another thing you can try is to see what parts of yourself you can see in someone you meet. Try it out and see what you 
      find.

      <h4>2. Your relationships are in your mind.</h4>

      How you choose to interpret people and your relationships makes a huge difference. So much of our relationships may be perceived 
      to happen out there somewhere.<br><br>

      But as mentioned in tip #1 in this article, your underlying frame of mind – do you build bridges or walls? – will determine much 
      about your interactions both new people and people you know.<br><br>

      So you really have to go inside. You have to realize that your interpretations from the past are interpretations. Not reality. 
      You have to take a look at your assumptions and expectations and thought habits. Find patterns that may be hurting you (and others). 
      This isn’t easy. Or always pleasant. You may discover that you have had some negative underlying habits of thought for many years.<br><br>

      But to change you have to do it. Instead of just keep looking at yourself as some sort of unmoving and objective observer of the 
      world and reality. A change in you could – over time – change your whole world.

      <h4>3. Avoid being boring.</h4>

      Don’t prattle on about your new car for 10 minutes oblivious to your surroundings. Always be prepared to drop a subject when you 
      start to bore people. Or when everyone is getting bored and the topic is starting to run out of steam.<br><br>

      One good way to have something interesting to say is simply to lead an interesting life. And to focus on the positive stuff. Don’t 
      start to whine about your boss or your job, people don’t want to hear that. Instead, talk about your last trip somewhere, some funny 
      anecdote that happened while you were buying clothes, your plans for the summer or something fun or exciting.

      <h4>4. Focus outward, not inward.</h4>

      A lot of people use the second, far less effective way. It is appealing because it’s about instant gratification and about ME, ME, 
      ME! The first way – to become interested in people – perhaps works better because it makes you a pleasant exception and because the 
      law of reciprocity is strong in people. As you treat people, they will treat you. Be interested in them and they will be interested 
      in you.

      <h4>5. Don’t get stuck in the questions.</h4>

      If you ask too many questions the conversation can feel like a bit of an interrogation. Or like you don’t have that much too contribute. 
      One alternative is to mix questions with statements. Just say what band you are really into instead of asking what band they are into. 
      Or say what you think about local sports team’s chances of winning the next game. Or, while using common sense, just what you are thinking 
      about what is happening around you right now. And then the conversation can flow on from there.<br><br>

      So open up and say what you think, share how you feel. And if someone shares an experience, open up too and share one of your experiences. 
      Don’t just stand there nodding and answer with short sentences. If someone is investing in the conversation they’d like you to invest too.<br><br>

      And like in so many areas in life, you can’t always wait for the other party to make the first move. When needed, be proactive and be the 
      first one to open up and invest in the conversation.

      <h4>6. Genuineness is awesome.</h4>

      I think that one of the most important things in a relationship of any kind is to be genuine. Few things are as powerful as genuine 
      communication and letting the genuine you shine through. Without incongruence, mixed messages or perhaps a sort of phoniness. It’s 
      you to 100%.<br><br>

      It’s you with not only your words but you with your voice tonality and body language – which some say is over 90% of communication – on the 
      same wavelength as your words. It’s you coming through on all channels of communication.<br><br>

      Being your geunine self – the one where you build bridges and are open and giving – will give you better results and more satisfaction in your 
      day to day life because you are in alignment with yourself. And because people really like genuineness.
