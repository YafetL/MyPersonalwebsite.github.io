        <h1>How to Use Your Body to Calm Your Brain</h1>
        <img src="./asset/image/yoga.jpeg"><br><br>
        You know that your brain controls your body, but did you know that your body also controls your brain? It’s a feedback loop that 
        works both ways. The activity in your brain changes every second based on what your body is doing. This process is called 
        biofeedback.<br><br>

        You may have thought that biofeedback required equipment, like a finger heart rate monitor or software. While technology can 
        make measuring bodily changes easier, it’s not necessary. You can alter your brain’s function with conscious biofeedback simply 
        by paying attention. For example, slowing your breathing or relaxing specific muscles can directly impact your thoughts, feelings, 
        emotions, and stress levels.<br><br>

        Your brain is perfectly equipped to notice what’s going on with your body — heart rate, breathing, muscle tension, sweating. 
        In fact, it’s doing it all the time anyway. You just have to notice it. To practice conscious biofeedback, you have to become 
        aware and guide the process.<br><br>

        Now a days, we have equipments and a neurofeedback therapy to calming the mind.However, you don’t need any equipment to successfully 
        use your body to calm your brain or to stimulate your vagus nerve. You just have to become aware of and influence your body through 
        your own actions. Some ways to do this are:

        <h4>Splash cold water on your face</h4>
        Rinsing your face with cold water stimulates your vagus nerve. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, stressed or anxious try filling 
        a sink with cool water and splashing your face. If you’re up for it, a cold shower or anything that exposes your body to cold 
        also does the trick.

        <h4>Use the power of music</h4>
        Music has been shown to increase or decrease HRV. While just listening to music works, making music has an even greater positive 
        effect.  Music engages most of your brain and limbic system, which largely governs emotions.

        <h4>Smile</h4>
        It’s a simple thing to do and really can improve your mood. Even a fake smile causes your brain to release dopamine. Think of a 
        fun time, a silly situation or your favorite joke. In your brain, there’s not much difference between forced and spontaneous 
        smiling.

        <h4></h4>Stand up straight</h4>
        Studies have shown that standing up straight in a more confident posture makes you feel more decisive and confident in your own 
        thoughts and beliefs, and confident postures also correlated with being more optimistic. Posture is an important source of feedback 
        for your brain. One study even showed that standing up straighter increases strength. Sitting straighter has similar effects.

        <h4>Calm your face</h4>
        There’s a muscle in the middle of your forehead in between your eyebrows, called the corrugator supercilii. It pulls your 
        eyebrows down and together, causing your forehead to wrinkle. In the same way your brain thinks you’re happy when you smile, 
        if your brow is furrowed and this muscle is tense, your brain interprets it as you being worried or upset. On bright days, 
        wearing sunglasses will reduce squinting and relax this muscle making your brain feel calmer.

        <h4>Relax your jaw and tongue</h4> 
        When you’re stressed, you tend to clench your teeth and tense your tongue. However, when you consciously loosen your jaw, your 
        brain relaxes too. You can wiggle it around and open your mouth wide. Make it a point to relax your tongue which also calms 
        your mind.

        <h4>Change your breathing</h4>
        Relaxed breathing slows your heart rate and activates the calm, parasympathetic nervous system. There are many breathing 
        techniques that calm your brain and body instantly. Conversely, breathe faster, and you will create more energy.

        <h4>Clench and relax</h4>
        Sometimes it’s actually helpful to clench your muscles and relax them to fully know the difference. Take a deep breath and 
        intentionally flex a tense muscle for a few seconds. After holding it, exhale and relax the muscle. The most important muscles 
        to relax are in your face. However,  don’t forget your hands, neck, shoulders, butt, back, and stomach. We do this in yoga. 
        It works!<br><br>
